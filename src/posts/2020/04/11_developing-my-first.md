For the past few months now I've been getting into 35mm photography. I've always enjoyed taking pictures, but I've only ever used a cellphone camera. While I've been using film for a while now, I've just been mailing the rolls off to a lab to have developed and scanned, instead of developing myself. Well, thanks to having a lot more free time on my hands due to the global pandemic, I finally decided to jump right in and buy the needed supplies.

Overall the process went better than expected the first time, with only a minor hiccup involving measuring out some chemicals halfway through. It was really awesome to get to put the blank film into the tank, pour some stuff in for a few minutes, and get physical images out!
